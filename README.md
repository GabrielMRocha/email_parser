# email_parser
Python script for scrapping flight data from airline emails

## How to:

Run the email_parser.py file in the same directory as the data folder.

The output .json files will be created in the same directory as the html files, each with their respective name.

The *path* variable is using unix format (/data). If running on Windows, change the *path* variable to (\\\data).
